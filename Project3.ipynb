    "\n",
    "### As one of the most densely populated cities in the world, New York is a prime example of heavy competition when it comes to food joints and options. The food and restaurant business is a challenging yet rewarding aspect of living in New York, which stands to be a good opportunity to open a specific restaurant that will serve delicacies from a different country. More specifically, this report will provide an exploratory analysis of New York, in order to open a Greek restaurant in an area which is not served nor it has a Greek restaurant in the vicinity. In other words, this report will utilize the knowledge gathered throughout this course in order to map all of the Greek restaurants in New York, upon which an investment analysis can be made in the future."

    "### In order to execute the goal of this report, the analysis presented hereinafter will adopt the Foursquare API information of the Greek restaurants in New York city. More specifically, the data will be gathered in the same fashion as the shown in the course, starting from the same location. However, in order to visualize the data, a different type of restaurant will be chosen. The starting location will remain the same as in the lectures. After visualizing the Greek restaurants in New York, an investment decision can be made. "
